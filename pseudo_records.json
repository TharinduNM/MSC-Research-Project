Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.\n\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST :  Pretty much was hanging out with two friends. I was watching the Lakers game. They won at the very last minute and I immediately hopped up and celebrated. Before I could even finish celebrating one friend started going on about how the Lakers suck. It just pissed me off so much I screamed at her to get out my room until she left. \n\n\nShe knows I'm a huge fan and she likes them too. She was only saying it to antagonize me. Am I the dick here?\nSolution: yes\nWhy? It is very rude to shout at someone and ask her to leave the room even if her comments may have antagonized the author. Hence author is at fault here.\n\nNew input: Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : I work in a restaurant and recently we had a few people leave the kitchen and a few from the front. Now our owner, who also acts as manager and chef, is working a station on the line and still maintaining the kitchen prep and business while me and the one other cook left work our regular jobs and pick up the slack. We're also in a city where cooks are few and far between and the few interviews we've had don't show up to their first day. Seriously, like 5 people in a row. \n\nThing is, I hate my job and have for almost a solid year, but I stayed because the money is decent and I didn't have another job to go to. However, that just changed. My fiancee got a full time job and I just lined up another position somewhere with better hours that's generally a better fit for me. My job now feels toxic for me, my coworkers are mean and mock each other for fun, the work is stressful, long hours mean that I don't see my fiancee as much as I'd like and I'm always tired because I never get enough sleep.\n\nHowever, my chef is a good guy. He's a bit of a dick sometimes and he doesn't show me the kind of respect I feel I deserve, but he isn't an asshole and if I leave I might actually be the final nail in his restaurants coffin if he can't find people within a week of my leaving. He doesn't deserve to have his business destroyed is what I mean. Not to mention, I'm actually really close with the few of my coworkers that aren't jerks so leaving will completely ruin work for them, pumping up stress and generally ensuring nobody has a good time.\n\nI know that what's best for me is leaving and you have to look out for number 1, I just feel like such an asshole doing it right now.

The event is a global annual festival honouring creativity and new ideas across multiple mediums, and will take place at Encore Las Vegas from 29 September through 7 October.\nThe London International Awards was founded in 1986 by President Barbara Levy and was the first truly international accolade to honour creative excellence in the realms of Cinema, Television, Print and Radio. Since then it has grown to honour 22 unique media assets, some of them being; Ambient, Branded Entertainment, Design, Digital, Health and Wellness, Integration, Medical \u2013 Craft, Music and Sound Production and Post-Production, Social Influencers and Verbal Identity.\nEach year, LIA gathers the best creative minds in the business across global borders to judge all entries and the juries comprise of the most talented, recognised and awarded representatives from within their respective fields.\nLeah will serve on this jury panel headed by Jury President Susan Credle, Global Chief Creative Officer of FCB, USA, which includes names like Adrian Bosich, Managing Partner/ Creative Founder of AIRBAG, Melbourne; Donald Chesnut, Global Chief Experience Officer of Publicis.Sapient, New York; Jayanta Jenkins, Global Group Creative Director of Twitter, San Francisco; and Menno Kluin, Chief Creative Officer of 360i, New York among others on the Jury.\nLeah will join the diverse international panel, comprising the most talented, recognised and awarded individuals. The panel will acknowledge advertising ideas that highlight new roles for brands and agencies, based on emerging media technologies or actions and brand experiences or ideas and supply chains in terms of being an influencer. Some prominent industry names Leah will be in the company of and exchange knowledge are; Executive Chairman/Global Chief Creative Officer of Leo Burnett Worldwide, Mark Tutssel; Head of Partnerships at Red Bull Media House, North America, Perry Fair; Chief Creative Officer/Partner of Mother, Corinna Falusi and Global Head of Creative, YouTube Originals LA, James Spence.\nLeah leads a dynamic young team at Dentsu Aegis Network (DAN) Sri Lanka and believes in inspiring them and pushing the boundaries when it comes to creative work emphasising the need to look for solutions for brands from a media neutral perspective. Her extensive knowledge and integrated experience globally has enabled the agency to form exceptionally strong client partnerships, creating innovative campaigns in recent times.\nShe began her career in TV production at Young Asia TV at the age of 15-year-old and soon grew to become a Producer, Writer, Director and Presenter. After moving to England for her degree in Broadcast Journalism, she interned at CNN and later became a Political and Military Correspondent for the Associated Press in Sri Lanka. Leah returned to London where she worked for some of the top experiential agencies producing integrated campaigns for global clients such as MTV Europe Music Awards, Esprit, Honda Dream Factory, Redbull, GAP, Virgin Trains, Google and the British Fashion Council.\nCommenting further on the context of advertising today, Leah adds, \u201cAdvertising was about creating icons and identities for brands, logos drawn and shared on napkins. But no longer. It now entirely relies on empowering audiences, on facilitating and encouraging independent decision making and celebrating individuality. Successful campaigns force you to question yourself and drive discovery, brands must have purpose that live beyond their obvious core remit. We are challenged now more than ever before to create genuine moments to engage people to notice us, so authenticity and transparency are critical traits that creatives must champion when creating campaigns.\nPrior to taking up her new role at DAN, Leah worked for world-renowned Harvey Goldsmith and his creative agency, Ignite, producing large scale events and creative strategies for global brands such as Barclaycard and NFL. She has also worked for large scale music festivals such as Glastonbury, Latitude, Reading and Leeds Festivals in the UK.\nLeah is the Co-Founder and Director of Sri Lanka\u2019s first international live music festival, the Electric Peacock Festival bringing Grammy Award Winning artists such as Roger Sanchez, Tinie Tempah, Basement Jaxx and Mark Ronson to Sri Lanka\u2019s shores since 2010.\nAccording to Leah, what are some critical traits that creatives must champion when creating campaigns and why?",

But in addition to all of those beautiful site pages, you also need landing pages. We suggest that you have at least one landing page set up when your site goes live.\nWhy landing pages? Well, these neat lil\u2019 pages are used to capture visitor information. You direct visitors to these pages to get them to complete a specific action.\nLanding pages are essential for lead capture-based businesses. They help you get web visitors into your funnel so you can use lead nurture sequences to eventually turn them into customers.\nBlogging is a time commitment and takes effort to maintain, but it\u2019s totally worth it! In order to get started, you\u2019ll need to dedicate either your time (by writing the posts yourself) or money (by hiring writers).\nIf you\u2019re just starting out and looking for early adopters, use your blog to talk directly to them. Blogging is an opportunity to let those early users know about the progress you\u2019re making, the changes you\u2019re enacting, and how to best use your product or service.\nIt can be hard to come up with social media fodder when your company is just starting out. By having blog content, however, you\u2019ll be able to not only share more on social media sites, but share content that directly links back to your own site, increasing overall site traffic and improving social signals.\nBlogs also make for great opportunities to hone your SEO skills. Optimize every post using SEO best practices and create content that\u2019s both useful and relevant to your target audience. Remember, you want to attract the right people to your site so that eventually your blog readers will become your loyal customers. Building up your SEO muscle via blogging will also help you increase your organic ranking and get more traffic.\nFrontApp, a B2B SaaS company, received 20% of their first beta sign ups by using inbound marketing.\nThey started a blog to share their experiences and communicate their vision and philosophy. As a result, not only did they get 400 total signups, but those initial 17 blog posts also generated 22,000 page views and 14,000 unique visitors in three months.\nUltimately, utilizing the power of inbound marketing is a great way to share your vision and company culture while simultaneously generating web traffic and getting early adopter leads into your funnel.\nWhat are some advantages of using a blog for inbound marketing, according to the text material?",

Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context and the story's general plot. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. You should write a new story ending that edits the original story ending as little as possible to regain coherence with the counterfactual context. To sum up, you should write the last three sentences of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the counterfactual context(second sentence) of the story.\nPremise: Olive was reading a thriller book when she heard a noise outside. \n Initial Context: She jumped out of her couch and went to the door. \n Original Ending: She looked through the peephole but saw no one.

    "prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How does Epicor plan to expand its SaaS offerings in the future?\n\nPassage: Epicor is joining the on-demand ERP (enterprise resource planning) fray with a new application aimed at small manufacturing companies as well as competing vendors such as NetSuite and SAP's Business ByDesign.\nLike NetSuite, Epicor Manufacturing Express Edition is fully multitenant SaaS (software as a service), wherein customers share a single instance of the software, with their data kept separate from others. This arrangement saves on underlying system resources and allows the vendor to push out updates and upgrades to many customers at once.\nEpicor's new application includes CRM (customer relationship management), production management, product management, financials, materials management and BI (business intelligence) capabilities such as role-based dashboards and a search engine.\nIt is also flexible enough to handle a range of manufacturing process styles, such as make-to-order, engineer-to-order and assembly, according to Epicor.\nThe software's various modules are built on top of a single relational database, providing tight integration, the company said.\nEpicor is guaranteeing 99.5 percent or higher system availability, with hosting in a tier-one datacenter certified under the SAS 70 Type II auditing guidelines. It has also built redundancies for backup and storage in a number of geographic locations.\nCustomers will be able to go live on the system within as soon as 20 business days, with the help of templates, pre-built sets of data and training, according to Epicor.\nEpicor Express uses a subset of functionality from the vendor's next-generation Epicor 9 release, according to Chad Meyer, director of product marketing. \"We took that footprint and took about 20-plus or so of the modules, bundled them together and created a template that overlays them, which simplifies the product for a job shop or small manufacturer,\" he said.\n\"With these small job shops, we understand there's a different workflow. Users could be doing quotes one minute, be on the floor next, and doing the books later in the day,\" Meyer added.\nSince Express is based on Epicor 9, it will be easy for customers to bring the application on-premises in the future if they choose, Meyer said.\nEpicor is also trying to protect customers' investment in the subscription-based model. For every year a customer remains on subscription pricing, Epicor will discount the price of moving to on-premises licenses by 20 percent, meaning that after five years it will cost nothing additional in license fees to make the switch.\nIn the future, Epicor plans to court larger customers with SaaS offerings, as well as different verticals, he said.\nPricing varies according to the number of users. A single user license would cost less than US$400 a month, while five users could come in under $1,000 per month, Meyer said. The software is initially available in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, with Europe the next likely target, he said.\nEpicor has five customers already live on the application, 15 in the process of implementation, and another 150 in the pipeline, Meyer said.\nOne initial user is Chirch Global Manufacturing, a McHenry, Illinois, manufacturer of close-tolerance progressive dies, metal stampings and assemblies. The company purchased another manufacturing firm in September 2008, and inherited an older version of Epicor's Vista ERP application, said CEO Anthony Chirchirillo.\nIt made more sense to make \"a quantum leap\" to a SaaS-based application, than attempt to bring the Vista software up to date, he said.\nChirch looked at other SaaS applications but was unsatisfied. \"The genesis of Epicor is as a manufacturing platform,\" while competing software offerings are merely adding on such capabilities, he said. \"That was a critical point for us.\"\nThe company is planning to stick with the SaaS model for the foreseeable future, he said. \"We're viewing it as the ability to stay focused on what we do well, and not trying to manage an IT environment.\"\nIn addition to smaller customers that are contemplating SaaS ERP applications, Epicor Express should also appeal to larger enterprises that are pursuing two-tier ERP strategies, tying smaller systems for new divisions or regions into a backbone application such as SAP, said analyst Ray Wang, partner with Altimeter Group.",

This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.\n\nIn the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform \"sanity checks\" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.\n\nIn the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.\n\n[Code] \nimport pandas as pd\nbusiness\\_path = \"yelp\\_academic\\_dataset\\_business.json\"\ndf\\_business = pd.read\\_json(business\\_path, lines=True)\ndf\\_business.info()\n\n# Schema of Dataframe\n# Columns in df with counts, datatype, and example values:\n# business\\_id (150346, object, ym3e\\_a1L4gyKZWU1-LuRYQ)\n# name (150346, object, J J Gandy's Pies)\n# address (150346, object, 5703 W Smith Valley Rd)\n# city (150346, object, Tampa)\n# state (150346, object, TN)\n# postal\\_code (150346, object, 46227)\n# latitude (150346, float64, 43.5939441)\n# longitude (150346, float64, -86.2621502)\n# stars (150346, float64, 4.5)\n# review\\_count (150346, int64, 21)\n# is\\_open (150346, int64, 1)\n# attributes (136602, object, {'ByAppointmentOnly': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True'})\n# categories (150243, object, Pizza, Restaurants, Food)\n# hours (127123, object, {'Monday': '12:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '12:0-0:0', 'Wednesday': '12:0-0:0', 'Thursday': '12:0-0:0', 'Friday': '12:0-0:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-0:0', 'Sunday': '12:0-0:0'})\n\n[Markdown]\n# Exploratory Visual Analysis\n\n## Initial Questions\n\n1.
